GIT  is a distributed vestion control and 
file management system -- every developer has a copy of project.


Why version control :
1.Made a change to code and need to revert back to a known good state
2.Have to maintain multiple versions of the software
3.Wanted to see the difference between two revisions
4.Wanted to see howq long a bug existed for.
5.Wanted to experiment without interfering with working code.


AS you make modifications in your code - at some moment you want to make a snapshot. 
You send it into Index(cache) by add command.
after you can send it into your local repository by commit command.
After - by push to remote repository.
